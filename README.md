# Loan-PayBack-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting loan payback probability for a financial lending dataset. The objective is to determine whether a borrower will successfully payback their loan or default. This type of predictive system is crucial for banks, microfinance institutions, and fintech lenders, as it helps reduce risk, and optimize lending decisions.
## Project Objectives
1. **Build a complete loan default prediction pipeline**
   - Load, clean, and preprocess the raw loan dataset
   - Handle inconsistent values, missing records
   - Encode categorical features using **Target Encoding**
